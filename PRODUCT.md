The *Cyface Nodes* are a collection of nodes that help you dealing with data signals and time series.

These nodes are developed und internally used by the Cyface GmbH. As we don't want to hide these hidden gems, we decided to make them open source and give you the chance to use them for your projects.

We do provide the Cyface Nodes without any warranty, but we are happy to share our experience and get input from the community. If you have any improvement in mind or found a bug, please let us know: mail@cyface.de
